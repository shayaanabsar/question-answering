# Question-Answering

A simple Question-Answering model that reads in a corpus and is able to answer comprehension-style questions on the data. It makes use of techniques including lemmatization, the tf-idf formula and Part-Of-Speech tagging.

To setup the code, run the following:
```bash
$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
$ python3 setup.py
```

To run the program:
```bash
$ python3 main.py
```
